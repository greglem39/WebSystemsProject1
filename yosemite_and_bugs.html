		<p>He's the rootenist, tootenist, shootenist long-eared cowpoke north, south, east, and 
		west of the Pecos. And if you don't get a-goin' he'll blow your carcass right out 
		from under yer hat!</p>
	
		<p>And if there's one thing Yosemite Sam hates, it's <em>rabbits</em>.

		<p>And given the ways - oh, the many, many ways - his arch nemesis, Bugs Bunny, has 
		laughed in the face of logic, the laws of physics, and all rationale for the sole 
		purpose of humiliating Sam, even when he could easily just slip away ... yeah, Sam
		might have a good reason.</p>
	
		<p>But, then again, Yosemite Sam is never anything less than a villain of some sort
		<em>before</em> Bugs shows up. So, perhaps we should cut our smug rabbit friend some 
		slack?</p>
	
		<p>For ease of looking over a few of the ways Bugs has thumbed his nose at physics
		throughout his battles of wit against Sam, let's consult a table with a few examples
		of their appearances together:</p>
	
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Episode Title</th>
				<th>Setting</th>
				<th>Physics Breaking Shenanigans</th>
			</tr>
				<td><em>Buccaneer Bunny</em></td>
				<td>Sam is a pirate hunting for treasure, and Bugs is quite confused by his 
				arrival on his happy island home.</td>
				<td><ul>
						<li>Bugs hands a parrot (who had been ready to tell Sam where he was
						hidden) a lit firecracker. The explosion blows the parrot's feathers 
						off.</li>
						<li>Bugs tricks Sam into thinking he's going to jump from the crow's 
						nest so Sam will attempt to catch him. Instead, he drops an anvil, 
						which, instead of crushing Sam, drops him through the entire ship and
						causes it to submerge.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			<tr>
				<td><em>Sahara Hare</em></td>
				<td>Bugs pops up out from underground, thinking he has reached Miami Beach, 
				when in reality he is in the Sahara Desert. Sam, dressed a la Lawrence of 
				Arabia, is in charge of a fort. Upon seeing Bugs while out on a scouting trip,
				he determines that "Great horny toads! A trespasser, gettin' footy-prints 
				all over my desert!" and moves to remove Bugs from his land.</td>
				<td><ul>
						<li>Sam tries to pole vault over the fort wall, but he ends up hitting
						the castle tower, going straight through and leaving a Sam-shaped
						imprint rather than going splat or just falling to death or serious 
						injury.</li>
						<li>Sam attempts to charge the gate, which Bugs opens to reveal a 
						comically oversized cannon, and allows Sam to run straight into the 
						barrel. Cue pause, change in music, and shout of "RETREAT!" before the
						cannon fires and launches Sam across the desert instead of... y'know 
						... killing him.</li>
						<li>Sam tries riding an elephant to break through the gate. Bugs deploys
						a mouse! The elephant then grabs Sam and uses him as an improve mouse
						swatter. Sam shows some minor bruising and scrapes, but no sign of 
						breaks, concussion, etc.</li>
						<li>Sam tries to use a long board to climb the front gate. Bugs uses
						a fire axe to chop the board into two pieces, Sam ... is then revealed
						to have been chopped as well. He survives this, defying both physics
						and, well, any semblance of mortality.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
				<td><em>Prince Violent</em></td>
				<td>Viking Sam the Terrible is heading toward a castle for pillaging. Upon 
				seeing Sam pass by his rabbit hole and enter the castle, Bugs decides to fight
				him.</td>
				<td><ul>
						<li>Bugs tricks Sam, again, utilizing an elephant to break down a door,
						into trying to break through a fake, painted-on door. When the elephant
						fails, Sam berates it, and is then promptly smacked around. Minimal 
						visible injuries.</li>
						<li>After supposedly making amends with his faithful elephant, Sam 
						directs it to aid him by catapulting boulders over the castle walls.
						Bugs pours pepper over the elephant's trunk, causing it to sneeze, lose
						its hold on the boulder, and drop it. On Sam. This flattens him, but 
						does not kill or do any lasting damage to him.</li>
						<li>Sam, after losing his elephant, tries to tunnel under the castle,
						only for a tower to <em>fall upon and pancake him.</em> Again, no lasting
						damage or death.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
		</table>
	
		<p>And more. So many more. In fact, there are only <strong>two</strong> episodes in
		which Yosemite Sam appears in that do not feature Bugs Bunny. And in each that his 
		accursed varmint rival oppose him, you can be certain that Warner Brothers had to ask
		physics to take a leave of absence so the poor guy wouldn't die.</p>
	
		<p>At some point, you just have to wonder if he should consider a new line of work.
		He might make a decent park ranger, no?</p>
