		<p>Now, here, we have two old favorites of mine. Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck have always
		been my favorite members of the Looney Tunes gang, with the addition of characters
		like Pepe le Pew, Sylvester, and Yosemite Sam. But this iconic pairing, there's 
		always been a rather fun rivalry. And that's never been more clear in their most
		memorable episode together.</p>
	
		<p>That's right. If you ever watched them, you knew this one was coming.</p>

		<p>Classic. As we can see here, Daffy Duck is repeatedly shot at point-blank range
		with a hunting rifle. In the face, no less. I won't go into detail on what that
		<em>should</em> do to a duck, but, I can assure you, it has nothing to do with his
		beak spinning up to rest atop his head or being blown off into his hand.</p>
	
		<p>Nor would he be able to reattach it afterward, let alone banter with Bugs and Elmer
		afterward.</p>
	
		<p>But, as we've established, reality is nowhere near as funny! The pain and
		humiliation of being outwitted by a sly <em>wabbit</em> must be amplified! Daffy Duck,
		step on up and win your prize - a legacy of being the butt of all the jokes!</p>
