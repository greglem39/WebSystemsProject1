	<h1>When Gravity Goes On Break</h1>

	<article class="gravity">
		
		<p>Let's admit it, we've all wished something like this would happen at <em>some</em>
		point in our lives. Whether it's in the midst of tripping and falling or watching
		in slow motion as a cup full of iced tea slowly tips and spills your nice drink
		all over your expensive laptop and assorted accessories.</p>
		
		<p>Okay, that last one is more my younger brother, but we all know we'd like
		gravity to be so kind as to take a second or two to enjoy a bit of laziness were
		we in that situation.</p>

			disaster.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>However, this is some low-level disaster. It's funny for a bit while the poor
		owner or their hapless son or friend flails their arms in a panic. We need more
		oomph for our laughs. So let's have a professional show us how it's done!</p>

			<figcaption class="looney">And how topical!</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Most of us have probably seen Wile E. and his improbable gravitational
		feats. But if you haven't, let me give you the basic rundown:</p>
		
		<ol><li>Wile E. chases Road Runner (or Bugs, occasionally) off a ledge.</li>
			<li>His prey makes it safely across.</li> 
			<li>Wile E. runs off the ledge and onto open air, and manages to make it
			about halfway across before he stops.</li>
			<li>The realization (and horror) sets in - he's no longer on solid ground.</li>
			<li>Wile E. feels around to reassure himself, then looks down to find
			no ground. He will then look back to the viewer, and wave, and then ...</li>
			<li>Gravity wakes up and drops him hundreds and hundreds of feet to the ground
			below.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Now, reading that sequence is great and all. But it doesn't quite capture the 
		full effect of what's happening. So, for the full effect, a link to a good video
		can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esR_uxKC27o">here</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Oh, Wile E., you never cease to amaze us.</p>
