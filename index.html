		<h2>Imagine, if you will ...</h2>
		
		<p>A world in which the laws of physics, as you know them, are meaningless. You
		are subject, not to the mysterious, yet mostly rational forces of gravity,
		mass, and other universal constants. Instead, your world is governed by something
		far more frightening, far more sinister...</p>
		
		<p><em>Comedic effect.</em></p>

		<p>Welcome to the world of every cartoon character you grew up knowing and loving.
		From Bugs Bunny's constant bedeviling of Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, and Yosemite Sam
		to Sylvester's inability to catch a caged Tweety Bird, and even to poor Wile E. 
		struggling to catch Road Runner with cockamamie schemes involving ever-malfunctoning
		ACME products, this is a realm where the logical advantages all save Daffy have
		over their quarry go out the window and slapstick comedy dictates the ebb and flow
		of the universe. How, you ask?</p>
		
		<p>Because reality would be a lot less funny. But who's complaining?</p>
		
		<p>So let's enjoy some fun examples of such flagrant violations of the laws of 
		physics that Sir Isaac Newton would try to wring the writers' necks.</p>
